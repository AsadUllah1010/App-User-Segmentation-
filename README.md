# App-User-Segmentation-
App user segmentation is the task of grouping users based on how they engage with the app. It helps find retained users, find the user segment for a marketing campaign, and solve many other business problems where you need to search for users based on similar characteristics. 
# Introduction
In the problem of app user segmentation, we need to group users based on how they engage with the app. So to solve this problem, we need to have data about the users based on how they engage with the app. I found a dataset containing data about how users who use an app daily and the users who have uninstalled the app engaged with the app. This data can be used to group users to find the retained and churn users.  Users who uninstalled the app had an average screen time of fewer than 5 minutes a day, and the average spent was less than 100. We can also see a linear relationship between the average screen time and the average spending of the users still using the app.
# Features
In the highly competitive world of apps, businesses and app developers need to understand and target specific user groups to improve engagement and retain more users to increase lifetime value. Here is a dataset we collected from an app to find a data-driven approach to segment app users based on their usage habits and spending ability to find users that the application will retain and lose over time. Below are all the features in the dataset:
1. userid: The identity number of the user;
2. Average Screen Time: The average screen time of the user on the application;
3. Average Spent on App (INR): The average amount spent by the user on the application;
4. Left Review: Did the user leave any reviews about the experience on the application? (1 if true, otherwise 0)
5. Ratings: Ratings given by the user to the application;
6. New Password Request: The number of times the user requested a new password;
7. Last Visited Minutes: Minuted passed by when the user was last active;
8. Status: Installed if the application is installed and uninstalled if the user has deleted the application
